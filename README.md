Worms3D - Corgi Tank War
Name: Markus Kromli
Aimed grade: G

Features added: I have simple navmesh point-click based movement
		I made an ambitious gun manager script that I did not have time to implement fully, the idea is to add powerups that would alter how the gun works.
        For a fun time do the following: Change "Time Between Shooting" to 0.05, and "Bullet Per Tap" to 1000, in the Gun Manager script attached to either player
		Players have 5 HP, and each bullet does 1 dmg, be aware that you can get hurt by your own bullet
		A game over screen once either player is reduced to 0 HP
